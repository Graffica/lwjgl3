		Loopback devices provide a way for applications to "read back" rendered
        audio without it being sent to an actual audio device. It allows
        applications to render audio as fast or slow as it needs, making it
        suitable for non-real-time rendering, and so it can be passed to an audio
        codec or something for further processing.

        The deviceName parameter is used to tell the AL which device or device
        driver to use for subsequent rendering. This may be NULL for an
        implementation-defined default, otherwise it must be a valid name returned
        by enumeration (and further must be a device capable of loopback
        rendering).

        A loopback device behaves largely the same as a playback device. You may
        query playback state and error codes, and create contexts, which can then
        be set as current to generate sources and buffers like normal.

        Note that loopback devices do not have either the ALC_SYNC or ALC_REFRESH
        attributes. Attempting to query them will result in an ALC_INVALID_ENUM
        error.
